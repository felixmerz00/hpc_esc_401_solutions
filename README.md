# High Performance Computing (HPC) Course Exercises

This repository contains all the solved exercises from my High Performance Computing (HPC) course, which is a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of parallel and high-performance computing. The course covers a range of topics fundamental to the development and execution of efficient, scalable programs on supercomputers and distributed systems.

## Key Topics Covered:
- **Supercomputer Architecture**: Overview of supercomputer hardware and architecture.
- **Unix/Linux & Remote Access**: Usage of terminal emulators to connect remotely and interact with HPC systems.
- **Code Editing, Version Control, and Compiling**: Basics of software development in an HPC environment, including version control and the compilation process.
- **SLURM Job Scheduling**: Creating job submission scripts for SLURM, a widely-used job scheduling system.
- **MPI & OpenMP**: Compilation and execution of parallel programs using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and OpenMP.
- **Parallel Programming**: Writing parallel programs and understanding the tradeoffs between different strategies.
- **Advanced Compilation and Optimization**: Techniques for optimizing code performance for HPC systems.
- **MapReduce and Cloud Computing**: Exploration of the MapReduce programming model and its application to ScienceCloud infrastructure.
- **GPU Programming**: Introduction to GPU programming using CUDA and OpenACC.
- **CSCS Swiss National Supercomputing Centre**: Running parallel programs on the high-performance systems at the CSCS Swiss National Supercomputing Centre.
