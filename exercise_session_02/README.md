# Exercise Session 02 #
In this session, you will compile and run your first programs on Eiger. This directory contains two versions of the code that were parallelized using MPI or OpenMP.

At the beginning I used no programming environment. Then I loaded cray before switching to gnu.
module list: lists all loaded modules.
module avail: lists all available modules.
module spider: allows me to search for modules. i.e., the command module spider PrgEnv-gnu/8.3.3 shows me information about that version of gnu.
