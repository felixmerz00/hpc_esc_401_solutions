Exercise 2

What results does your code produce?
Run with flag -O0
sum=10022429073.341873
The program ran for 6.246 seconds

Run with flag -O1
sum=10022429073.341873
The program ran for 1.38 seconds

Run with flag -O2
sum=10022429073.341873
The program ran for 1.349 seconds

Run with flag -O3
sum=10022429073.341873
The program ran for 1.366 seconds


Do you know other ways to get timings?
Maybe I could convert my program to a slurm job. Then the email from cscs would state the runtime.


How big is the difference in execution time with the different flags?
There is almost no difference between using the flags O1, O2 and O3. However, with  the flag O0 the runtime increases by almost five seconds.


How can you make it even faster?
The flags -ffast-math and -mavx2 might speed up the program further.
